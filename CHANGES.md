# Modifications in this branch

## [Game.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/Kyle-Deliverable-2/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Game.java)
### Long Method : start()
* Used the extract method to create new functions in order to shorten the start() method.
* Refactored duplicate code from the start(), town(), and home() methods. 
* Removed unused switch case (duplicate).
* Commented out unused code. Would delete, but there are plans to use it in the future.
*
