# Modifications in this fork


## Changes in the MoreEnemies branch

### This branch addresses the following issue:
#### Add way more enemies and monsters into the game, ([issue #19](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues/19) in the source hhaslam11/Text-Fighter repository, [issue #13](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/issues/13) in the forked emmamickas/Text-Fighter repository)

### Desired Modifications:
#### In the current game, there are 10 enemies and monsters for the fighter to kill. The monsters typically come from a fantasy world. In the changes, the number of monsters have now more than doubled up to a total of 23 enemies and monsters spanning all genres of monsters (Greek mythology, Anglo Saxon legends, and good old folk stories).

### Modified Files:
#### The following packages were modified in the change
* [Game.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/InlineDocumentationUpdate/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Game.java)
* [Settings.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/InlineDocumentationUpdate/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/player/Settings.java)
* [Help.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/InlineDocumentationUpdate/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Help.java)

### Testing:
#### Testing for this issue was fairly straightforward. There wasn't much required for testing before the enemies were created, but regression testing and playtesting after implementation were both important to confirm accuracy and truancy.
