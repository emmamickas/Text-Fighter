## Changes in the deadCodeRefactor branch

### This branch addresses instances of extreme contraction in identifiers/variable names
### Desired modifications:
#### In the current project, there are multiple instances of extremely shortened words in variable names, or extreme contractions. The changes include refactoring these identifier names to be more understandable.

### Modified files:
#### The following files were modified in the change:
 * [Enemy.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/LBSExtremeContraction/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Enemy.java)
 * [Saves.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/deadCodeRefactor/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Saves.java)


### Testing:
####  The following tests were performed to ensure that behavior was preserved after refactoring/changes:
