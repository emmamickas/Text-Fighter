# See below for more changes from the main branch

## Changes in the ShowSpecificPotionStats branch

### This branch addresses the following issue:
#### Show Specific Potion Stats, ([issue #58](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues/58) in the source hhaslam11/Text-Fighter repository, [issue #7](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/issues/7) in the forked emmamickas/Text-Fighter repository)

### Desired modifications:
#### In the current functionality, when a player views their stats, they are only able to view a total number of potions used, but not individual totals for different types of potions that they have used. The changes include separating the totals for individual potion types to display each total, while also keeping a total of all potions used by the player.

### Modified files:
#### As viewable in the [Dependency References folder](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/ShowSpecificPotionStats/Dependency%20References), the following files were modified in the change:
 * [Potion.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/ShowSpecificPotionStats/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/player/Potion.java)
 * [Stats.java](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/ShowSpecificPotionStats/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/player/Stats.java)

### Testing:
####  The following tests were performed to ensure that behavior was preserved after refactoring/changes:
 * [Potion](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/ShowSpecificPotionStats/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/player/PotionTest.java)
 ##### See [here](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/blob/ShowSpecificPotionStats/TESTING.md) for more information on testing.
 
 ### Resolution:
 #### The branch was merged with master, closing issue #58:
 [Pull request #125](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/commit/659955becfa0eb803f4b214821f18dbef9419da8)

## Changes in the CriticalHits branch

### This branch addresses the following issue:
#### Critical Hits, ([issue #25](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues/25) in the source hhaslam11/Text-Fighter repository, [issue #1](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/issues/1) in the forked emmamickas/Text-Fighter repository)

### Desired modifications:
#### In the current functionality, the damage that a weapon can do can be increased by a critical multiplier based upon the weapon's type. The changes include adding another critical modifier that increases the damage done by weapons with bullets only. This modifier has a 0.01% chance to activate and increases damage by a factor of 10.

### Modified files:
#### As viewable in the [Dependency References folder](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/CriticalHits/Dependency%20References), the following files were modified in the change:

## Changes in the CheatsIndexOutOfBoundsFix

### This branch addresses the following issue:
#### Critical Hits, ([issue #130](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues/130) in the source hhaslam11/Text-Fighter repository, [issue #9](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/issues/9) in the forked emmamickas/Text-Fighter repository)

### Desired modifications:
#### In the current implementation, selecting the weaponstash cheat involves accessing an array of weapons in which the final index being referenced is the size of the array, which is out of the bounds of the array. The changes involve updating the condition of the loop that accesses the array to prevent the violation of the index.

### Modified files:
#### As viewable in the [Dependency References folder](https://github.com/emmamickas/Text-Fighter/tree/CheatsIndexOutOfBoundsFix/Dependency%20References), the following files were modified in the change:
